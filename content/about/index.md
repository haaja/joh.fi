Hello there! My name is Janne Haapsaari and I'm a software developer based in Helsinki, Finland.
At the moment I'm writing code for [Qvik](https://qvik.com). It should go without saying but
this is my personal journal and opinnions reflected here are my own.

## Things I do:

* I write bugs.
* I forget to write tests.
* I tell lousy jokes.
* I love to travel.
* Free software <3

## Feel free to contact me:

* Email: haaja@iki.fi
* PGP: [0x2FB9DEF6](/pgp/haaja_public_key.asc) or
[0x2FB9DEF6](http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=0x2FB9DEF6)
