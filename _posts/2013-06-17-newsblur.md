I recently wrote about
[leaving Google Reader](http://www.joh.fi/2013/03/14/goodbye-google-reader/).
Of course this decision was made for me when Google announced that they will
shutdown Google Creader on 1st of July. In the beginning I simply used
thunderbird as my RSS reader but eventually this became too limited as for
instance I couldn't easily access my thunderbird installation from work. Then
I switched to [theoldreader](http://theoldreader.com/) which is more or less a
Google Reader clone with additional features. It worked just fine and was free
as in it didn't cost anything. However theoldreader failed to fetch all the
articles for me. Of course I couldn't complain much as I was not a paying
customer but it was enough to push me for searching for an alternative.

After some googling I bumped into [NewsBlur](https://www.newsblur.com) which
not only worked fast and without errors but also was open source. I have the
option of installing it on my own server and also premium service is provided
for very affordable 24$/year price. I chose the latter option. So far newsblur
has filled all my RSS reading news by being super fast to use and fetching all
the articles. They also offer mobile applications for all major platforms
albeit I have only used the Android version. It works fine but does not offer
the same user experience as the web user interface.

Anyway I can highly recommend newsblur for anyone still looking for
replacement for Google Reader. If you don't feel like paying for service that
you are most likely using on a daily basis, then just
[host your own instance](https://github.com/samuelclay/NewsBlur). For everyone
else there is paid service offered at
[newsblur.com](https://www.newsblur.com). They also offer free service but
it's fairly limited and will not be enough for most users.
