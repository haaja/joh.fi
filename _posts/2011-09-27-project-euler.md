[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) is a website containing computational
problems intended to be solved by small programs. Currently there are 351
problems to be solved and all of the problems should be doable within one-
minute-rule. In other words you are doing something wrong if computing the
solution takes more than one minute (or at least your program could be
optimized). If you're interested in programming or mathematics then
Project Euler is for you. Solving problems is fun and along the way you may
learn something new.

I remember hearing about Project Euler a long time ago but for some reason
never tried solving the problems. Last Sunday I was bored and somehow ended up
on Project Euler and started doing problems. I decided to use python because I
haven't really used python before. So far I have solutions for the first 21
problems and problem 67 which was exactly the same as problem 18, except
computationally harder. My solutions can be found from
[GitHub](https://github.com/haaja/project_euler). I'll try to make it a habit
and continue solving these problems every now and then but I give no
guarantees. :)
